# Goals
- To develop individualized prediction models for gastrostomy in ALS patients

**Target Variables**     
- Time to dietary consistency change (ALSFRS_Q3_Swallowing score dropping to 2.0, among patients whose initial FVC is more than 50%)

# Gastrostomy prediction

**Goal** : 
build a model to predict the time to dietary consistency change

**Select features according to previous studies** :    
- Age(ordered categorical data by 5yrs), Gender, onset_site(Bulbar/Non-bulbar), onset_delta(months), diag_delta(months), diag_minus_onset(months) 
- ALSFRS (total score, item scores), FVC, Creatinine, Weight
- Reference https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17482960802566824?journalCode=iafd19, https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3051
- calculate mean values over the first 3 months for ALSFRS, FVC, Creatinine     
- calculate slope values over the first 3 months for the time-resolved features (ALSFRS/FVC/Creatinine/Weight, per month)            
- exclude cases with missing values in onset_delta because of a large proportion of missing values (same cases with missing values in diag_delta, onset_site)

- Imputation using iterativeImputer in scikit-learn

**Stepwise forward selection & Create meta-feature** : 
- Age, onset_delta, mean_FVC, ALSFRS_total_slope, mean_Q1_Speech, mean_Q2_Salivation, mean_Q3_Swallowing, mean_Q7_Turning_in_Bed, slope_Q3_Swallowing, slope_Q6_Dressing_and_Hygiene, Creatinine_slope, weight_slope was selected through Stepwise forward selection
- Due to high multicollinearity, meta feature 'mean_Q1_2_3_mouth' was added and 'mean_Q1_Speech'/'mean_Q2_Salivation'/'mean_Q3_Swallowing' were removed. 
- Due to high multicollinearity of ALSFRS_total_slope/slope_Q6_Dressing_and_Hygiene, 'slope_Q6_Dressing_and_Hygiene' was removed.

**Algorithm** :          
- Accelerated failure time (parametric)
- Cox proportional hazard model (semi-parametric)
- Random survival forests (machine-learning)

**Results** :       
- Demonstrations; Printing prediction curve on test set

Prediction matches well with Kaplan Meier in Rapid and Intermediate group but not much in slow group

Thick colored lines are interquartile range between 25 to 75 % probability time to event. And the dots in the middle are the 50% probability times
